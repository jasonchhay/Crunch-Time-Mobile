# Crunch Time

The Android application has the user create timers dedicated for studying and breaks in order to maximize productivity while ensuring that the user does not burn themselves out from constant work. The study timer and the break timer run sequentially, starting after the other timer has finished so that the user can continue with their work/break without having to interfere with the application.
